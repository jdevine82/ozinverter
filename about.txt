This git is an opensource project. The orginal design comes from a bloke on Finders Island going by the handle of OZTULES.
He has given the design to the public domain. I have simply penned the schematic down by reverse engineering his PCB as this was not 
written down anywhere. The files here contain the basic version and also a version coming with switchmode regulators. Free for anyone to use.
